Welcome to Dash Engine 1.3!

Dash Engine is a framework developed in Unreal Engine 4 designed to give a starting point for developing Sonic fangames. It provides a lot of the basic necessities Sonic games have, such as slope physics, various skills like the Boost and Spindash, objects like Springs and Rings, and even a proper options menu!

Dash 1.3 comes with two characters to start with; Modern Sonic, a stiffer to control Sonic who uses skills like the Boost and Stomp to navigate with precision, and Adventure Sonic, a more freeflowing to control Sonic who uses slope physics in conjuction with the Spindash, Roll, and Dropdash to gain speed through the environment.

Of course, you don't have to stick with what's present in the base framework. Everything can be changed to your liking! The skills Sonic has, how objects look, to even adding entirely new objects and mechanics, the possabilities are endless!

# Setup/Installation

Dash Engine uses C++, and as such requires a unique compilation method. You can't open the project straight out the box sadly.

Luckily, we have a handy video to help you out!
